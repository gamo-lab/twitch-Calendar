            <h2> Christmas Day</h2>
            <p>
                Christmas is an annual festival commemorating 
                the birth of Jesus Christ, observed primarily on 
                December 25[a] as a religious and cultural celebration 
                among billions of people around the world. A liturgical 
                feast central to Christianity, Christmas preparation 
                begins on the First Sunday of Advent and it is followed 
                by Christmastide, which historically in the West lasts 
                twelve days and culminates on Twelfth Night. Christmas Day 
                is a public holiday in many countries, is observed religiously 
                by a majority of Christians, as well as celebrated culturally by 
                many non-Christians, and forms an integral part of the annual holiday season.
